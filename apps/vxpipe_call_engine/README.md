# Vxpipe Call Engine

The `vxpipe_call_engine` OTP application owns Vxpipe's protocol-neutral call
lifecycle and processing runtime.

Its first vertical slice accepts a `Vxpipe.CallEngine.Command.CreateRoom`, starts
a room incarnation through the named `Vxpipe.CallEngine.RoomSupervisor`, and
returns a `Vxpipe.CallEngine.Room.Snapshot`. The room authority is a significant,
temporary child: its termination ends that incarnation instead of independently
restarting authoritative state.

The next slice accepts `Vxpipe.CallEngine.Command.JoinParticipant` for a live
room. The room authority serializes admission and starts each temporary
participant authority through the room incarnation's named dynamic participant
supervisor. The resulting public snapshot contains domain identity and state,
not gateway sessions, WebRTC, JSON, or RTVI data.

Development rooms can also resolve a deterministic text agent. Its agent
participant uses the normal participant supervisor, while its responder runs as
a separate capability under the room's dynamic capability supervisor. Attached
connections can submit protocol-neutral `SendText` commands and receive targeted,
room-sequenced participant-turn, `TextOutput`, and `AgentTurnCompleted` events.
The engine still has no dependency on the gateway or RTVI.

The first audio slice adds one speech-to-text capability and bounded media
ingress per attached human connection. It accepts protocol-neutral Opus frames,
streams them through the Deepgram Flux adapter, and admits normalized turn and
replacement-transcription signals into the room authority. Only Flux
`EndOfTurn` commits the audio turn and dispatches its final text to the
deterministic agent. Provider I/O and raw audio remain outside the room-authority
mailbox, and the engine still contains no WebRTC or RTVI types.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `vxpipe_call_engine` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:vxpipe_call_engine, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
