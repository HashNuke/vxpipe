# Vxpipe Call Engine

The `vxpipe_call_engine` OTP application owns Vxpipe's protocol-neutral call
lifecycle and processing runtime.

Its first vertical slice accepts a `Vxpipe.CallEngine.Command.CreateRoom`, starts
a room incarnation through the named `Vxpipe.CallEngine.RoomSupervisor`, and
returns a `Vxpipe.CallEngine.Room.Snapshot`. The room authority is a significant,
temporary child: its termination ends that incarnation instead of independently
restarting authoritative state.

The next slice accepts `Vxpipe.CallEngine.Command.JoinParticipant` for a live
room. The room authority serializes admission and starts each temporary
participant authority through the room incarnation's named dynamic participant
supervisor. The resulting public snapshot contains domain identity and state,
not gateway sessions, WebRTC, JSON, or RTVI data.
